Initial project review-

I have spent many years using python technology as its been a staple language throughout my software engineering experience. In order to present this I felt like it was more than necessary to create a production grade application using production grade software using a production grade framework such as DJango.

Experience with DJango-

Usin Django was a pleasant surprise as despite being quite a heavy framework which I wasn't realy accustomed to, it definetly makes your life much easier with features such as the ORM to automate migrations, furthermore, there was a surplus of availiable middlewares which were able to help me ensure stability and security in the site.
